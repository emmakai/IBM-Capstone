The neighborhood, Long Island City, is just right across East River of Manhattan, and therefore becomes a very popular place of living of young professionals. Rent is reasonable, and the area is less populated. It has less dining places and coffee shops compared to Manhattan in general. So, Takumen faces less fierce restaurants competitions, yet the neighborhood residents can afford to pay and enjoy a casual, contemporary Japanese dining experience. "
